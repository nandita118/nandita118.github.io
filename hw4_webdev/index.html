            I found the project ImageNet Roulette to be a fascinating and necessary 
            commentary on the implications of AI and human bias permeating emmerging 
            technologies -- used for everything from hiring to criminal databases.

        <p id="para2">
            It is indeed alarming to recognize how bias in early training sets for AIs
            has permeated through our society and digital footprint. And if humans are 
            innately biased, are we then doomed to bias machines?
        </p>
        <p id="para3" class="cleared">
            In my opinion bias is preventable, at least on some levels, with the implication
            of strict policy guidelines when creating and proliferating training datasets. However, 
            the way in which we must implement these policies is controversial and confusing.
            For example, should only those of similar race/ethnicity/gender be allowed to tag that 
            particular data? Or should a diverse range of people tag each data piece? How shall we go about
            fixing or cleaning the pre-exisisting data? Humans are complicated, multi-faceted beings.
            Therefore, regardless of the diversity, we will be making sacrifices in categorizing and 
            generalizing human behavior, at least for now, with the technologies that currently exist.
            However, we can prevent much bias when there is a diversity of opinion and leadership on the matter
            of improving AI.
