		<h3>Nandita Kohli Reflection</h3>
		<h2>Ways of Seeing by John Berger</h2>
		<p>Ways of Seeing was an enlightening documentary on how technology has changed our perception of fine art. When art is reproduced, Berger argues, it loses some value and takes on new meanings. Its new environment plays a huge part in this manipulation.

		<p>The overflowing surplus of images and data in our digital realms today have led to a diminishing appreciation for beauty that is real, authentic, and unfiltered. This unfiltered beauty was thoughtfully constructed with detailed intentionality. As photos become more and more commonplace in our surroundings we lose the significance of these details. We lose the morals they were designed to convey. An important historical scene, meant to communicate important life lessons turns into simple scenery or disconnected parts of a lost whole.

		<p>This is truly a tragedy. Without the knowledge of the past we are bound to repeat its mistakes. Without intentionality we are lost in a never-ending sea of ones and zeroes that mean nothing. Therefore it is crucial to take the time to look at each piece of art with purpose and dig deeper to understand its roots.
