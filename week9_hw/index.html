    <h2>What is Web 2.0</h2>
    <div class="text" id="para" > <!-- onmouseover="mouseOver(this.id, 'red');" onmouseout="mouseOut(this.class, 'white');" -->
        The core of Web 2.0 comes from increased user interaction and putting the users first. 
        The theory is that services automatically improve the more people use them. In order to be Web 2.0 you must
        leverage customer self-service and algorithmic data management to reach out to more people - also known as
        "the long tail". The value of the software is now interconnected to the "scale and dynamism" of
        the data it helps to manage. Both marketing dominance and software dominance are determined by user contributions
        in the Web 2.0 era. Google is a key example of Web 2.0.

    <h2>Web Squared</h2>
    <h3>"Web meets World – that’s Web Squared."</h3>
    <div class="text" id="quote">
        "A key competency of the Web 2.0 era is discovering implied metadata, 
        and then building a database to capture that metadata and/or foster an 
        ecosystem around it."

        It is all about the patterns in this evolving Webscape. Where will the web take us? 
        How can we better use it to solve the pressing issues of the world today? Web 2.0 is all 
        about harnessing collective intelligence - as the web grows the world grows, and vice versa.
        I found this article quite fascinating. As the people on the web grow in size, the web takes
        on more and more structure, as email did 10 - 15 years ago. The web has endless possibilities.
        Our data shadows grow larger and larger each day. Once we are able to interpret these data shadows
        in more and more complex ways, with artificial intelligence, VR/AR, automation, and data visualizations,
        the possibilities are endless and could lead to breakthroughs in everything from politics to medicine to
        a favoured, more profitable Taxi route. You never know.

        On the flip side, something I found interesting was the concept that at a certain point data retracts to form a collective identity.
        In Jeff Jonas' work on identity resolution, "each new load of data made the database smaller, not bigger. 
        630 million plus 30 million became 600 million, as the subtle calculus of recognition by "context accumulation" worked its magic."
        I wonder how our collective web identity will shift through time. I hope it will evolve into a more mature and technologically savvy identity
        in the future.
